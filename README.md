## Individual hack day!

Today you will spend the entire day individually to scope, create and finish a small project.

It is important that you stay on Epicenter when doing your projects. If you're not at the office, slack us your location so that we can pay you a visit!

### Instructions:

You are supposed to code something on your own. It is OK to find inspiration from sources online as long as the end result is something unique. Making a carbon copy (or a copy with minimal changes) is __not__ OK.

Remember that you should scope it in a way that you think you can complete this in one day.

You are allowed to use any techniques that we have used so far in this course. If you want to explore something new, talk to us first.

If you want to co-operate in pairs and build one part each of a larger application, come talk to us first. Pair programming is not allowed in this exercise, but we might be able to find a solution if you have a really good idea that can be clearly separated into two parts.

Create a new branch named after yourself and work in this.

__VERY important__: Push your solutions to GitHub on a regular basis. As soon as something works - commit with a descriptive comment and push! Before you go home for the day, push everything you got.


### Presentation
Everyone will get to present their work in front of part of the class. This will take place at 13:00 on Friday.
